/* ===== 1. How many searches? =====
Given a sorted list 3, 5, 6, 8, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18 and using the recursive binary search algorithm, identify the sequence of numbers that each recursive call will search to try and find 8.
1. 3, 5, 6, 8, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18: middle of array = 12; 8<12 so will look in lower half of array
2. 3, 5, 6, 8, 11: middle of array = 6; 8>6 so will look in upper half of array
3. 8, 11; returns 11: 8 < 11 so will look in lower half of array
4. 8 = 8 so returns
